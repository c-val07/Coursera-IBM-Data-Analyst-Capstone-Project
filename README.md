Coursera IBM Data Analyst Capstone project - 

The goal of this project was to undertake the responsibilities of a Data Analyst for a company.
Multiple sources were given where I had to prepare, analyze, and collect data to build dashboards utilizing
the software IBM Cognos Analytics. The dashboards were designed to uncover and identify currently trending database 
skills and programming languages, as well as to predict those that are expected to be in higher demand in the future.
The pptx file includes an overview of the data and details of the table used to complete sales team, engineering, and CEO 
requests. With the information discovered, I improved the database structure by using SQL queries clearing missing values,
manipulating data, deduplicating, and data validation.
