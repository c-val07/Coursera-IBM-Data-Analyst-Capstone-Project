Coursera IBM Data Analyst Capstone project - 

The goal of this project was to undertake the responsibilities of a Data Analayst for a company.
Multiple sources were given where I had to prepare, analyze, and collect data to build dashboards utilizing
the software IBM Cognos Analytics. The dashboards were designed to uncover and identify currently trending database 
skills and programming languages, as well as to predict those that are expected to be in higher demand in the future.
